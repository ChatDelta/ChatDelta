# Contributing to ChatDelta

Thank you for considering contributing! This project welcomes pull requests from developers of all experience levels.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) stable.
3. Install the dependencies with `cargo build`.

## Development Workflow

- Make your changes in a feature branch.
- Keep code readable and well commented.
- Run `cargo check` to ensure the code compiles.
- If you have `rustfmt` installed, run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- Add tests where appropriate with `cargo test`.
- Open a pull request describing your changes.

If you encounter issues building, note that some crates may require an internet connection during setup. This repository tries to keep dependencies minimal.
