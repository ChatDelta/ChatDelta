# ChatDelta v0.4.0 Integration Wishlist

This document contains feedback and feature requests for the `chatdelta` crate based on our experience integrating v0.4.0 into the ChatDelta TUI application.

## Successfully Integrated Features ‚úÖ

1. **ClientConfigBuilder** - Great addition! We're now using it to configure timeouts and retries:
   ```rust
   ClientConfigBuilder::default()
       .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
       .retries(3)
       .build()
   ```

2. **Better structured API** - The v0.4.0 API is cleaner and more intuitive.

## Feature Requests and Improvements üöÄ

### 1. Streaming Response Support
**Priority: HIGH**
- Our TUI would greatly benefit from streaming responses as they arrive from the AI providers
- Suggested API:
  ```rust
  async fn send_prompt_streaming(
      &self, 
      prompt: &str,
      callback: impl Fn(String) -> Result<(), Error>
  ) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>;
  ```
- This would allow real-time display of responses in the TUI

### 2. Native Conversation History Management
**Priority: HIGH**
- While `ChatSession` exists, it would be helpful to have built-in conversation history per provider
- Suggested features:
  - Automatic context management for multi-turn conversations
  - Token counting and automatic truncation when hitting limits
  - Export/import conversation history for persistence

### 3. Built-in Delta/Diff Generation
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Currently we implement our own delta analysis using Gemini
- Would be great to have a built-in `compare_responses()` function
- Suggested API:
  ```rust
  pub fn compare_responses(responses: Vec<AiResponse>) -> DeltaAnalysis {
      // Returns structured differences between responses
  }
  ```

### 4. Provider Capabilities Query
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Add ability to query what features each provider supports
- Example:
  ```rust
  pub fn get_capabilities(&self) -> ProviderCapabilities {
      // Returns: max_tokens, supports_streaming, supports_images, etc.
  }
  ```

### 5. Rate Limiting and Quota Management
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Built-in rate limiting to prevent hitting API limits
- Track API usage and costs
- Suggested features:
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Usage statistics tracking
  - Cost estimation based on token usage

### 6. Parallel Execution Improvements
**Priority: LOW**
- The `execute_parallel` function is great, but could benefit from:
  - Progress callbacks for each provider
  - Ability to cancel in-flight requests
  - Partial results handling (get results as they complete)

### 7. Error Type Improvements
**Priority: LOW**
- More granular error types would help with error handling:
  - `RateLimitError` with retry_after field
  - `AuthenticationError` 
  - `ModelNotAvailableError`
  - `NetworkError` vs `APIError`

### 8. Model Selection Flexibility
**Priority: LOW**
- Currently we pass model as a string to `create_client`
- Would be nice to have an enum of supported models per provider:
  ```rust
  pub enum OpenAIModel {
      GPT4,
      GPT4Turbo,
      GPT35Turbo,
      // etc.
  }
  ```

### 9. Mock Client for Testing
**Priority: LOW**
- A mock implementation of `AiClient` for testing would be helpful
- Could return predefined responses for unit tests

### 10. Unified Token Counting
**Priority: LOW**
- Different providers count tokens differently
- A unified token counting API would help with:
  - Estimating costs before sending requests
  - Managing conversation history within token limits
  - Comparing efficiency across providers

## Documentation Requests üìö

1. **Migration Guide** - A guide for migrating from older versions would be helpful
2. **Best Practices** - Examples of optimal configuration for different use cases
3. **Performance Tips** - Guidelines for maximizing throughput and minimizing latency
4. **Provider Comparison** - Document differences in behavior between providers

## Bug Reports üêõ

None found so far! The v0.4.0 release seems very stable.

## Overall Feedback üí≠

The chatdelta crate v0.4.0 is a solid foundation for multi-provider AI applications. The addition of `ClientConfigBuilder` and better structure is much appreciated. The main areas for improvement would be streaming support and better conversation management, which would make it even more powerful for interactive applications like our TUI.

Thank you for creating and maintaining this excellent library!
